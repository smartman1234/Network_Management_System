docsTestCapability OBJECT-TYPE

    DESCRIPTION
            "Indicates the ability of this device to support the 
            programmable features identified by the TYPE field from
            the CM/CMTS TLV Table.
            Each octet within this octet string represents eight tests.
            For example, the first octet represents tests one through 
            eight (with the msb representing test one) as identified
            by the TYPE field."

            "Indicates the current operating status of tests initiated
            through the docsTestSetupObjects. The octet representation
            is identical to that used by docsTestCapability. A bit 
            representation of one indicates that a test is currently
            active, while zero indicates the test is inactive or has
            completed."

    DESCRIPTION
            "Corresponds to the TYPE field from the CM/CMTS TLV Table.
            The default value of zero indicates no test has yet been
            initiated. A 'wrongValue' error should be returned in
            response to a write request for a test not supported by
