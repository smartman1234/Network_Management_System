-- *
-- * SCTE Status: ADOPTED JANUARY 11, 2002
-- *  
-- * This MIB contains information about the communications state of
-- * devices connected to the transponder, as well as indicating what
-- * device-specific MIB each device supports.  These devices are typically
-- * connected to the transponder via a serial communications link (bus).
